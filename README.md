#Rock Paper Scissors Game :
I chose this game because its a fun activity and past time for me and my friends and its very easy to participate and play. Also rock paper scissors doesnt need any additional props/objects to play. It can just be played using hands. The best reason for making this project would be to gain experience and learn the process that goes to design such a game . I was very interested to build JavaScript logic and implement it to function properly. 

#Features :
1. This game is played between user and a computer and the one who reaches 10 points first wins the game . 
2. The use has 3 choices between rock, paper and scissors and the computer choice is generated randomly.
3. Based on the rules the game can end in user winning, computer winning and a draw if both choices are same.
4. Simple animations & text are also added to show the user what is happening and adds an aesthetic vibe to it.
